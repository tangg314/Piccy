# Piccy, Picture Sharing Website
ICS 415: Introduction to Programming for the Web

Our team consisted of Joseph Tapang, Gary Tang, and Garry Hwang. For ICS 415, we created a picture sharing website. The website is mobile friendly because of Bootstrap. A guest can register for an account and start using the website. The account management system is handled by Meteor packages. Users are able to easily upload a photo by using the widget implemented using Cloudinary. Photos can be dragged and dropped or browsed the computer. Inside the user's home page, uploaded photos are neatly displayed using the Blue-imp gallery. Please refer to the Pics_PaperPrototype.pptx for website concept pictures.
